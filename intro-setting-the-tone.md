# First Day Introduction

## Setting the Tone

*Instructor's Note:* Participants should have been asked to read ["Stereotype Threat: A Summary of the Problem"](https://dynamicecology.wordpress.com/2014/04/28/stereotype-threat-a-summary-of-the-problem/) as preparation for Day 1.

### Code of Conduct

[Code of Conduct](http://software-carpentry.org/conduct/)

Everyone in this room belongs here.
You have exactly the right background, training, and amount of experience that you need to participate in this workshop.

### Implicit Bias

#### Optional Exercise

*Instructor's Note:* Participants should keep their eyes closed while you or your co-instructor tally the responses. The intent is that the participants see that most of them independently pictured the same person, even though they were only given an occupation as a prompt.

1. "Close your eyes, I want you to **picture a [job title here]...**"
2. "Raise your hand if the person you're picturing..."
3. The intent is to record on a whiteboard/ Etherpad this person's characteristics (e.g., sex, ethnicity, glasses/ no glasses) that, as we will see, are independent of the job title.

**Why does this matter?**

### Stereotype Threat

We hope you all read  ["Stereotype Threat: A Summary of the Problem"](https://dynamicecology.wordpress.com/2014/04/28/stereotype-threat-a-summary-of-the-problem/); does anyone have any reactions or thoughts to offer about what they read?

So, all of us, to some degree, have preconceived notions about what groups of people are qualified for certain jobs.

This is a problem, and not just for our own political correctness.

This is a problem that can lead to stereotype threat.

**Stereotype threat arises when negative stereotypes about a particular group can cause members of that group to underperform.**

It's a well-established phenomenon supported by over 300 studies. For instance:

* A study by the Educational Testing Service found that asking women to indicate their gender after taking the AP Calculus exam, rather than before, would lead to 16.7% more women starting college with Calculus credit (as cited by Claude Steele's book Whistling Vivaldi).
* A 2006 study in the Journal of Applied Psychology (by Brown and Day) administered an exam to a mixed group of students. They found that black students performed significantly worse than their white peers when the exam was described as "an IQ test" but there was no performance difference when they exam was described as "a set of puzzles."

**Who's heard of "impostor syndrome?" It's a similar thing.**

**Why does stereotype threat lead to reduced performance?**

* Internalizing a negative stereotype leads to anxiety when you're faced with a task on which it's widely assumed "people like you" don't do well.
* Also, anxiety about performance takes up "mental bandwidth" because the person is multitasking, switching between concentrating on the task and thinking about whether his or her performance is a reflection of group identity.

**We know we can combat stereotype threat, however.**

* Studies show that making learners aware that stereotype threat exists is often enough to reduence any performance disparities.
* Acknowledging that abilities and intelligence can be expanded is also important.

What you're going to be learning about over the next two days is not easy or simple and it does not come "naturally" to anyone.
However, you are capable of acquiring these abilities.
Remember that feelings of anxiety may be the result of stereotype threat and have nothing to do with your actual ability to learn.
